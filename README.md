# Image Download Automation Project

This project automates the process of downloading images from a specific website using Selenium and Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to download images from [https://www.shesfixingherhair.co.uk/gallery/index.php](https://www.shesfixingherhair.co.uk/gallery/index.php) and organize them in the `images` directory. The automation script checks for existing images, logs download attempts, and reloads the page after a certain number of downloads.
